# Dries Mellaerts
I am a passionate front-end developer, eager to follow every new move in the digital world. My approach is to always think ahead - not going for the easy solution but for the best, most relevant one. Always strive to improve and have a keen eye for detail.

I really see developing as a hobby for me because after working hours I'm reading articles, viewing videos, or working on a personal project. My other hobbies are more sport-related. The main one is basketball, I've been playing it since childhood. Also, I'm an amateur cyclist riding with friends and participating in some local races.
